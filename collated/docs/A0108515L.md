INTRODUCTION
------------

TaskRuby is a simple tool for busy professionals to schedule and manage their daily to-do tasks! It is a Java desktop application that allows
efficient interaction with a GUI and does not require connection to the Internet. It is developed with a command-line interface approach.

This guide describes the design and implementation of TaskRuby. It will help you understand how TaskRuby works and how you can further
contribute to its development.

SETTING UP
----------

#### Prerequisites

1.  **JDK** `1.8.0_60` or later

> Any Java 8 version is not enough. The app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2.  **Eclipse** IDE

3.  **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do from step 2 onwards given in [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))

4.  **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace

#### Importing the project into Eclipse

1.  Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer

2.  Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)

3.  Click `File` > `Import`

4.  Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`

5.  Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory

6.  Click `Finish`

> -   If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' configuration files, choose to 'keep'.

> -   Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish. (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process.)

> -   If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.

**Logging Levels**

-   `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the
    termination of TaskRuby

-   `WARNING` : Precaution measures to be taken when continuing

-   `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by TaskRuby

-   `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in
    debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

TESTING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:

If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. *Neon* or later),
enable assertions in JUnit tests as described
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

-   To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and
    choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`

-   To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package,
    test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:

See
[UsingGradle.md](file:///E:\Desktop%20Stuff\CS2101\CA3)%20Product%20Manual%20UG%20and%20DG\UsingGradle.md)
for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1.  **GUI Tests** - These are *System Tests* that test the entire App by
    simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the
    `guitests` package.

2.  **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They
    include,

-   *Unit tests* targeting the lowest level methods/classes. e.g.
    AddCommandTest.java

-   *Integration tests* that are checking the integration of multiple
    code units (those code units are assumed to be working).

-   Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking
    multiple code units as well as how they are connected together.

**Headless GUI Testing**: Thanks to the
[TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use, our GUI tests
can be run in the headless mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not
show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on
the Computer while the tests are running. See
[UsingGradle.md](file:///E:\Desktop%20Stuff\CS2101\CA3)%20Product%20Manual%20UG%20and%20DG\UsingGradle.md#running-tests)
to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

INTRODUCTION
------------

Do you feel bombarded with 'things to do' continuously? Do you keep
forgetting stuff to do? Fear not, for you now have TaskRuby! A Getting
Things Done (GTD) Tool created by TeamRuby, to help YOU get things done!

Benefits of TaskRuby: Command Line Interface, One-shot Approach,
Internet-independent!

QUICK START
-----------

1.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. TaskRuby will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2.  Download the latest `TaskRuby``.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.

3.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TaskRuby application.

4.  Double-click the file to start the application. The GUI (below) should appear in a few seconds.

    Figure 1: GUI Display

5.  Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. 
    e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window. 
    
    Some example commands you can try:

    >   `list` : lists all tasks.

    >   `add` `Buy vegetables` `\D today ` `\p 2` : adds a task named `Buy vegetables` to TaskRuby.

    >   `delete` `1` : deletes the 1st task from TaskRuby.

    >   `exit` : exits TaskRuby.

6.  Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.
