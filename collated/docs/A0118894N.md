DESIGN
------

### Architecture

*Figure 2: Activity Diagram of TaskRuby*

Figure 2 gives a high-level design overview of TaskRuby. A quick overview of each component follows.

`Models` has only one class called Task. It is responsible for initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them
up with each other.

Our event handler, `TaskController`, is a class that plays an integral role at the architecture level.

-   TaskController : This class is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of *Event
    Driven* design).

The rest of TaskRuby consists of these four components,

-   `UI` : Displays UI of the App.

-   `Logic` : Executes the command.

-   `Model` : Holds the data of the App in-memory.

-   `Storage` : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components defines its API in a specified class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see Figure 3) defines its API in the `TaskRuby.java` class.

### UI component

*Figure 4: Class Diagram of the* `UI `*component*

**API** :
[UI.java]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.
`CommandBox`, `TaskName`, `Priority`, `Status` etc. All these parts are
loaded on start-up.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI
parts are defined in `.fxml` files that are in the
`src/main/java/views` folder. For example, the layout of the
MainWindow is loaded from TaskRubyIdea.fxml.

The `UI` component executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
It also binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the user
interface can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes. The `UI`
responds to events raised from various parts of TaskRuby and updates the
user interface accordingly.

### Logic component

*Figure 5: Class Diagram of the* `Logic `*component*

**API** :
[Logic.java]

`Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command. The command
execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise
events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a
`BaseCommand` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Figure 6 below illustrates the Sequence Diagram for interactions within
the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

### Model component

*Figure 7: Class Diagram of the* `Model `*component*

**API** :
[Model.java]

The `Model` stores a `Task` object that represents the taskâ€™s properties
and the Task Manager data. `Model` does not depend on any of the other
three components.

### 

### 

### Storage component

*Figure 8: Class Diagram of the* `Storage `*component*

**API** :
[Storage.java]

The `Storage` component can save `UserPref` objects in json format and
read it back. It can also save the task data in xml format and
read it back.

FAQ
---

**Q**: Why does the application not start even after double-clicking the JAR file?

**A**: Ensure that you have a Java version 1.8.0_60 or later installed in your system.

**Q**: How do I check the current Java version installed on my PC?

**A**: Press the windows (or start menu) button, and type â€˜About Javaâ€?, hit enter. There will be a pop-up (see Figure 2 below) 
indicating the current Java version on your PC.

Figure 2. About Java pop-up

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: Install the application in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains 
the data of your previous TaskRuby folder.
