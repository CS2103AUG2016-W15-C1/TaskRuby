#### Viewing help: `help`

Format: `help`

#### Adding a task: `add` 

Adds a task to TaskRuby.

Format:
`add` `TASK` `[\d START_DATE_TIME] [\D END_DATE_TIME] [\p PRIORITY_TAG]`

> Both date time can be entered in any format and are not compulsory: e.g. today 5pm, 1900 tomorrow, 25 nov, 5.30pm

> Priority Tag ranges from 1 to 3: **1**-High, **2**-Medium, **3**-Low

Examples:

-   `add` `Buy vegetables \D 10pm today`
-   `add` `CS2103T Tutorial \d tomorrow 1000 \D 1100 \p 1`

#### Deleting a task: `delete`

Deletes the specified task from TaskRuby.

Format: `delete` `TASK_ID`

> The ID refers to the number shown in the most recent listing and MUST be a positive integer: i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:

-   `list`, `delete 2` : Deletes the second task in TaskRuby
-   `find CS2103`, `delete 1` : Deletes the 1st task in the results of the `find` command

#### Finding tasks: `find`

> Only full words will be matched: e.g. `find` `CS2103T` will not match `CS2103` but `find CS2103` will match `CS2103` and `CS2103T`

> Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. **OR** search): e.g. **find** `CS2103T` will match `CS2103T Tutorial`

Examples:

-   `find` `CS2103T` : Returns `CS2103T Tutorial` but not `CS2103 Tutorial`
-   `find` `CS2103T` `CS2101` `CS3235` : Returns all tasks with keywords `CS2103T`, `CS2101`, or `CS3235`
