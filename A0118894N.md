### UI component

*Figure 4: Class Diagram of the* `UI `*component*

**API** :
[UI.java](file:///E:\Desktop%20Stuff\CS2101\src\main\java\seedu\address\ui\Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.
`CommandBox`, `TaskName`, `Priority`, `Status` etc. All these parts are
loaded on start-up.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI
parts are defined in `.fxml` files that are in the
`src/main/java/views` folder. For example, the layout of the
MainWindow is loaded from TaskRubyIdea.fxml.

The `UI` component executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
It also binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the user
interface can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes. The `UI`
responds to events raised from various parts of TaskRuby and updates the
user interface accordingly.

### Logic component

*Figure 5: Class Diagram of the* `Logic `*component*

**API** :
[Logic.java](file:///E:\Desktop%20Stuff\CS2101\src\main\java\seedu\address\logic\Logic.java)

`Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command. The command
execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise
events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a
`BaseCommand` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Figure 6 below illustrates the Sequence Diagram for interactions within
the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

### Model component

*Figure 7: Class Diagram of the* `Model `*component*

**API** :
[Model.java](file:///E:\Desktop%20Stuff\CS2101\src\main\java\seedu\address\model\Model.java)

The `Model` stores a `Task` object that represents the task’s properties
and the Task Manager data. `Model` does not depend on any of the other
three components.

### Storage component

*Figure 8: Class Diagram of the* `Storage `*component*

**API** :
[Storage.java](file:///E:\Desktop%20Stuff\CS2101\src\main\java\seedu\address\storage\Storage.java)

The `Storage` component can save `UserPref` objects in json format and
read it back. It can also save the Address Book data in xml format and
read it back.
